fix axis on plot with both green and red laser. Can do this by normalizing or by having two color-coded axis.
overplot red and green fits
the prof wants data plots to be discrete points with error bars
why is red laser phase shifted in interference/beta?
there is a bell curve of minima on the laser 2s. try to subtract this and then fit?
