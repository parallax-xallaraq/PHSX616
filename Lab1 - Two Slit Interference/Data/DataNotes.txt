Laser interference pattern. ,Two slit
"Laser is shone through a stationary single slit, then a stationary double slit. It then shines through a movable single slit which can be panned across the photodiode. ",
We are measuring the interference pattern by recording the voltages from the photodiode as we sweep the single slit across it,
Double Slit: 5.82 mm,
Note: The prof said that we should have a smaller interval when we collect our data. So were doing it again,
Laser off (V),0.011
"Sometimes flickers to 0.011, but usually ",+/- 0.001
